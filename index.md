  I'm Assistant Professor of Digital Media at <a href="https://brocku.ca/">Brock University</a> in the <a href="https://brocku.ca/humanities/digital-humanities/">Centre for Digital Humanities</a>. I teach on topics relating to digital culture, natural language processing, and app development. I've published articles on U.S. literature and culture, which have appeared in <i>Modern Fiction Studies</i>, <i>Mosaic</i>, and <i>Symploke</i> among others. I have also published on issues relating to digital humanities in both <i>Digital Studies</i> and <i>Digital Humanities Quarterly</i>. My forthcoming book is called <i>Cybersecurity and the Humanities</i> (Emerald Press, 2020).
